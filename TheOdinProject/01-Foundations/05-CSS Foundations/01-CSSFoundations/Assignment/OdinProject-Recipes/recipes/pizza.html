  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
   <li>1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for pan</li>
   <li>2 slices applewood-smoked bacon</li>
   <li>4 canned pineapple rings</li>
   <li>1 pound fresh pizza dough, at room temperature</li>
   <li>½ cup pizza sauce (from 1 [14-oz.] jar)</li>
   <li>2 cups (8 oz.) pre-shredded whole-milk mozzarella cheese</li>

  </ul>

  <h2>Directions</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Preheat the oven to 500 degrees F (260 degrees C) with a rack in the lower position. Oil a large rimmed baking sheet with olive oil. </li>
    <li>Meanwhile, heat a large skillet over medium-high. Add bacon and cook, flipping occasionally, until golden brown and crisp, 5 to 7 minutes. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate. </li>
    <li>Pour out pan drippings without wiping pan clean, and return skillet to heat. Add pineapple, cook until lightly browned and caramelized, 3 minutes per side. Remove from pan. Chop bacon and cut pineapple rings into 3/4-inch pieces. </li>
    <li>On a lightly floured surface, roll dough to a 12-inch circle and place on the oiled baking sheet. Prick dough with a fork several times to reduce air bubbles. Spread pizza sauce evenly over dough, leaving a 1 1/2-inch border around edges. Sprinkle with cheese, onions, Canadian bacon, pineapple, and chopped bacon. </li>
    <li>Bake in preheated oven until cheese is melted and bubbly, toppings are lightly charred, and crust is golden brown, 10 to 15 minutes. Let stand 5 minutes before serving. </li>
  </ol>
